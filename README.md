A scifi RPG Resource Management Game.

## About this program

This program is a scifi resource management RPG, which strives to have quasi-cross-platform connectivity.
What this means is this program aims to be usable anywhere using the communications app Discord.
The main program will run natively on any desktop as an Electron app, while some features will
be available everywhere through Discord. The program boasts few features currently,
but that will change with continued development.

### Discord Bot

The Discord Bot (DI) is a portal to access the Galanarius system in a basic form anywhere 
thanks to Discord's versatility. The actions taken using this access are limited to purely text based 
commands and actions. These actions include things such as creating your character, choosing a faction, 
moving your character or commanders, and basic actions such as gathering or refining resources.

### Desktop Application

The Desktop Application (DA) gives the full experience of the Galanarius system, 
with an accompanying GUI, allowing for more complex actions such as battles, and crafting. 
This platform has not yet been fully developed, and is still in its beginning stages as a feature.

## About the developer

This project is a way for me as a programmer to test my skills in new languages and/or frameworks,
specifically web development langauges, coupled with the node and electron js frameworks/libraries.
This project is meant to put all the skills I have learned and am still learning to the test.
Any feedback is welcome, as I only have a few close friends reviewing the code when they can.
Any contribution is accepted gladly, though it may not be used if it does not align with
the overall vision of the project.
