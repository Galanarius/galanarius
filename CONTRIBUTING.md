# Contributing to Galanarius

This project is an expirement meant to help its developers practice and learn common programming practices and skills.
Due to this fact, this project will likely have many logical and optimizational issues.
While contribution is welcome, it likely will not be implemented quickly, if at all, due to the nature of the project.
This project is very much a work-in-progress, and there is no set end vision, only a loose roadmap laid out in [TODO.md](https://github.com/Queejon/galanarius/blob/master/TODO.md).
