# changes

## Build version

master 1.0

## DA

## DI

## Overall

### Shifting focus away from DA implementation to DI implementation

### The scope of DI is possibly being changed to allow for the implementation of other botting platforms as access points for the commands

### After not touching the project for about 8 months, a reintroduction is required on my part, including some minor refactoring of code to facilitate uniformity throughout the project

### Maps now store reference data for the NPCs residing in their sector, better optimizing action functions
